Add protein sequence searching to taxID_to_GIs.pl

After creating the family-specific blast database:
    1) do a blast query on that database for mitochondri*
    2) get the gis from that query
        a) use those gis to create two databases:
            i) mitochondrial
            ii) excluding mitochondrial from full database

Must do database operations against nt and (at least) refseq_genomic. For example, of the 22 records
for taxon group 8948 full mitochondrial genomes, only 12 are found in the nt database, and 10 are
refseqs, so are (I'm assuming) in the refseq_genomic blast database.

            
The clustering is not working as anticipated. Instead of clustering different species into gene groups,
it is clustering by species. This is because, for the mitochondrial groupings that I have tested, the
FASTA databases I am clustering include full mitochondrial genomes. Thus cd-hit-est is clustering the
database against the longest sequence, which is the full mt genome. So it is picking all the sequences
that align to the full mitochondrial genome above xx% sequence identity. This is obviously picking up
all the mitochondrial genes for a species instead of what I want it to do.
