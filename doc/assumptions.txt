1. Taxa include species and subspecies according to NCBI taxonomy
2. Looking at all vertebrate families as subsets
3. Does it make sense to do this analysis using NCBI taxonomy to subset?
4. How do we decide which topology is correct for a family? (need to know for comparative purposes to
    show whether nuclear or mitochondrial performed better)
    a. node resolution?
    b. external phylogeny information? (literature search/outside database)
    c. the size of the project increases massively with each non-automated step
5. How do we deal with adding both mitochondrial and nuclear data together? Do we want to do that?
6.
