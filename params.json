{"name":"MitoNuc","tagline":"","google":"","body":"MitoNuc\r\n=======\r\nEvan McCartney-Melstad\r\n\r\nThis is a set of tools that will be used to do a few things:\r\n*  make many subsets of NCBI databases\r\n*  run clustering analyses on these sub-databases\r\n*  run phylogenetic analyses on the resulting nucleotide/protein clusters\r\n\r\nThis software was written on a Linux machine. It should work cross-platform,\r\nhowever, as long as Perl, BioPerl, BioPerl-run, and blast+2.2.27 are installed\r\nand configured correctly. See below for some tips on that.\r\n    \r\nMitoNuc requires several things to function. Among these are:\r\n*  BioPerl-live (latest version of BioPerl from GitHub)\r\n*  BioPerl-run (latest version from GitHub)\r\n*  blast+2.2.27\r\n*  Perl needs to know where to find the bioperl-run and bioperl-live modules\r\n    *  can do this by modifying the $PERL5LIB environmental variable\r\n    *  for instance: export PERL5LIB=\"$HOME/bioperl/bioperl-live:$HOME/bioperl/bioperl-run/lib:$PERL5LIB\"\r\n*  Perl needs to know where to find the blast+ binaries\r\n    *  do this by setting the $BLASTPLUSDIR environmental variable\r\n*  Perl needs to know where to find the blast(+) databases\r\n    *  must set the $BLASTDB environmental variable to point to the databases\r\n    (which you must download)\r\n    \r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
